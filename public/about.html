<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Kyasarin, a passionate and curious web developer based in Japan. I
  enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites from the ground
  up.
</p>

<p>
  I started learning web development to turn ideas into reality using code. I`m
  currently focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I`m also
  exploring tools like Git, Visual Studio, and .NET.
</p>

<p>
  This portfolio is a collection of my work and learning journey â€” from small
  practice projects to more advanced applications. I believe in continuous
  growth, creative problem-solving, and writing code that not only works but
  also makes an impact.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore my projects or connect with me for
  collaboration or feedback.
